# Latent Drifting in Diffusion Models for Counterfactual Medical Image Synthesis

This repository contains the website for our CVPR 2025 paper on counterfactual medical image synthesis using diffusion models.

## Paper Abstract

We present **Latent Drifting**, a novel approach for counterfactual medical image synthesis using diffusion models. Medical counterfactual generation is crucial for creating controlled variations in medical images that can help with diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical education. Our method addresses a critical limitation in current diffusion-based approaches that often struggle to maintain anatomical consistency while introducing clinically meaningful variations. By strategically manipulating the latent space trajectories during the diffusion process, Latent Drifting generates highly realistic counterfactual medical images that preserve patient-specific anatomical structures while modifying targeted pathological features.
